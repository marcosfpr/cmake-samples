CMake stores compilers for each language in the
CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER variable, where <LANG> is any of the supported languages, for
our purposes CXX, C, or Fortran. The user can set this variable in one of two ways: 


1. By using the -D option in the CLI, for example: 

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..

2. By exporting the environment variables CXX for the C++ compiler, CC for the C
compiler, and FC for the Fortran compiler. For example, use this command to use
clang++ as the C++ compiler: 

    $ env CXX=clang++ cmake ..


Where can we find which default compilers and compiler flags will be picked up by
CMake for our platform? CMake offers the --system-information flag, which will dump
all information about your system to the screen or a file. To see this, try the following:
        
    $ cmake --system-information information.txt
