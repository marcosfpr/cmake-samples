CMake has the notion of build types or configurations, such as Debug, Release, and so
forth.  The variable governing the configuration to be used when generating the build system is CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
This variable is empty by default, and the values recognized by CMake are: 

1. Debug for building your library or executable without optimization and with debug
symbols, 

2. Release for building your library or executable with optimization and without
debug symbols, 

3. RelWithDebInfo for building your library or executable with less aggressive
optimizations and with debug symbols, 

4. MinSizeRel for building your library or executable with optimizations that do not
increase object code size.
